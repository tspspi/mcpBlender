# mcpBlender User Manual

Operator and MCP-client guidance for modeling, animation, rendering and asset
workflows. For installation and a quick start, see [README.md](README.md).
For permanent service setup, see [persistent installation](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md).
Tool arguments, policies, recovery behavior and workflow limits are documented
below; the repository-owned [skills](README.md#skills) provide task-specific agent
guidance.

## Installation

Requires Python 3.11+, Blender 4.5+ and a Unix system supporting same-user socket
peer checks (FreeBSD/macOS/BSD `getpeereid`, or Linux `SO_PEERCRED`). Live tests
currently cover the installed FreeBSD Blender 5.0.1; other versions are unqualified.

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -e '.[remote,test]'
.venv/bin/mcpblender --config ./mcpblender.conf --init-config
```

For development with dependencies already available, every CLI example also works
as `python3 -m mcpblender.server ...` from this checkout. No installation into
Blender's Python environment is needed.

For a wheel-based permanent runtime, FreeBSD service supervision and client/skill
setup, see [persistent installation](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md).

## Blender startup and attachment

`get_capabilities` reports the connected Blender version and worker command
inventory. Its `domain_support` entries distinguish `structured_partial` (listed
typed commands with an explicit scope) from `python_only` (no dedicated typed
workflow). `python_only_domains` summarizes the latter. A domain name alone does
not imply full Blender support, installed optional APIs or permission to execute
Python. Use MCP `tools/list` for the current connection's permitted tools, and
[VALIDATION.md](VALIDATION.md) for tested versions and scenarios. Discovery itself
does not establish qualification or create a recovery checkpoint.

The MCP server can start Blender through `start_blender`. With
`launch.auto_start=true` (the default), the first operation needing Blender also
starts it lazily when its key has startup permission. Set this false for explicit
startup only. Operation-history and storage queries never require Blender startup. Default startup creates a fresh GUI
instance with factory settings, auto-execution disabled, and our bridge bootstrapped.
The bootstrap disables the splash screen for that session without saving user preferences.
It does not modify Blender preferences or install files into Blender. The GUI has
an **MCP** sidebar panel with bridge start/stop controls.

For a CLI launch before connecting an agent:

```sh
mcpblender --config ./mcpblender.conf --start-blender
```

For a headless session, add `--background` or set `launch.background` in JSON.
Background mode stays alive to accept commands, supports camera rendering, and
cannot capture a GUI viewport. Startup reports readiness only after a round trip
through the socket and confirmation of the launched Blender PID. A live socket is
reused; a busy bridge does not trigger another launch. A launch file lock coordinates
multiple server processes using the same socket.

To attach to an existing GUI without restarting it, use Blender's Python console:

```python
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, "/absolute/path/to/mcpBlender")
from mcpblender.blender import bridge
bridge.start("/absolute/private/directory/bridge.sock")
```

Use the same `bridge.socket_path` in server configuration. `bridge.stop()` detaches.
For optional persistent add-on installation, generate a ZIP and install it through
Blender's **Preferences → Add-ons → Install from Disk**:

```sh
mcpblender --addon-zip /tmp/mcpblender-addon.zip
```

Enable **mcpBlender Unix Bridge**. It uses the default socket unless the Blender
process has `MCPBLENDER_BRIDGE_SOCKET` set. An add-on installation is unnecessary
when starting Blender through the MCP server. Do not enable the installed add-on
and separately register the checkout's UI module in the same session.

## Temporary outputs and retention

Temporary-output retention is enabled by default for callers with library-write
permission. After a successful submission, bounded background maintenance runs
opportunistically, at most once per hour per owner/library (not as a periodic
service when the server is unused). Defaults retain temporary outputs for seven
days, keep at least one hour of recent output, and target a 2 GiB temporary-output
budget. History details expire after 30 days. Configure these under `retention`;
set `enabled=false` to disable automatic maintenance while keeping preview/manual
cleanup available.

Only automatically generated render/screenshot/video paths and generated frame
directories are registered as temporary. Explicit output paths, saved projects,
exports, unregistered legacy files, recovery checkpoints and logs are excluded.
Within generated frame directories, only expected frame, manifest and preview
video filenames are candidates; other files remain. Pins, active/interrupted
operations, symlinks and files modified after operation completion are protected.
Structured use of a temporary output as a material/VSE/import/upload input pins
its output group; that pin stays until explicitly removed. Pin outputs before
custom Python or external software uses them, because those dependencies cannot
be inferred. Saved `.blend` files do not automatically reveal external dependencies.

Use `retention_status`, then `preview_retention_cleanup` to inspect candidate files,
logical bytes, protected groups and history entries. Apply the ten-minute plan
with `apply_retention_cleanup(plan_id=...)`; permissions, pins, file identity and
policy are rechecked before deletion. `set_operation_retention(operation_id=...,
pinned=true)` protects outputs and history, including history for explicit-path
deliverables. Applying cleanup and pin changes require library-write permission.
These tools do not start Blender. Scans and deletion batches are bounded; a
truncated scan reports a lower bound and the budget may remain unmet.

History cleanup drops bulky parameters/results/progress, preserving operation IDs,
request IDs, digests and final states. `details_pruned=true` means the old result is
unavailable; reusing its request ID still returns the original operation and never
re-executes it. SQLite can reuse the freed pages; databases are not automatically
vacuumed and small request-ID tombstones are retained. Expired artifact metadata
is removed when its file is missing. Cleanup reports logical bytes deleted and
fresh filesystem space; filesystem snapshots can retain physical storage.

## Structured shaders and material presets

Structured shader authoring works with Python execution disabled. Use
`shader_node_catalog` to discover supported node types, installed socket identifiers
and property choices; `inspect_shader_graph` inspects existing materials, including
imported node types. Domain-tool arguments go inside `params`.

`configure_shader_graph` creates a complete graph from `material`, `nodes` and
`links`; replacing an existing material requires `replace=true`. Nodes have a
unique `name`, supported Blender node `type`, typed input socket values, optional
properties, and image/color-ramp options. Links name their source/destination node
and socket. Use identifiers or indexes when socket display names are ambiguous.
Script nodes and arbitrary RNA properties are excluded. Image paths stay inside
the caller's library. Socket types/ranges, link destinations and cycles are checked
on a temporary material before applying changes; rare failures during application
can still leave partial edits. Animated/driven or linked materials are refused.

For incremental editing, use `configure_shader_node`, `connect_shader_nodes`,
`disconnect_shader_input` and `remove_shader_node`. Omitted inputs/properties are
preserved; existing input connections need `replace_existing=true` to replace.
`apply_material_preset` creates `PBR`, `TEXTURED_PBR`, `GLASS` or `EMISSION` graphs.
PBR presets accept base-color, roughness, metallic and tangent-space normal maps,
texture scaling and image packing. Base color uses sRGB; data maps use Non-Color.
Roughness/metallic maps use their red channel. Existing materials require explicit
replacement. Assign the result using `assign_material`. These presets provide
Blender shading; arbitrary procedural graphs and glass need target-engine review
or baking before delivery. The GLB qualification covers the textured PBR preset.

## Named actions and local recipes

The built-in `preview_setup` action accepts `objects` (mesh names), an optional
fresh `prefix`, `view`, `projection`, `margin` and light `strength`. It creates
persistent key/fill/rim area lights centered on evaluated asset bounds and a fitted
active camera. Existing lights remain; render settings and selection are preserved.
Fit uses the current frame and render aspect: refit after pose or aspect changes.
For example, run `preview_setup` with `{"objects": ["Building"], "prefix": "Studio"}`,
then render with camera `Studio_Camera`. Resource-name collisions are refused
before editing; setup errors remove resources created by the shim and restore the
previous active camera. This action requires scene-edit permission.

`game_asset_prepare` takes `objects` (up to 16 meshes) and an optional
`triangle_budget`. Its default plan only preflights and reports evaluated geometry,
UVs, material slots, transforms and budget warnings. This remains discoverable to
read-only callers and does not create recovery checkpoints. To request edits, set
`apply_rotation_scale`, `generate_uv` or `triangulate` explicitly; triangulation adds
a live `MCP_GameTriangulate` modifier. Shared geometry requires `make_single_user`
for destructive mesh edits. Existing UVMap data requires `overwrite_uv=true`.
All targets are checked before editing. Optional `save_path` and `export_path`
write a project and GLB inside the library without overwriting existing files.
Export includes only the named meshes and restores the user's selection. The
editing/export workflow refuses skinned and shape-key meshes; use the qualified
rig/morph delivery tools for those. Reports are advisory and do not certify Godot
compatibility, texture fidelity or collision suitability. Optional steps require
their own permissions; `describe_action` lists possible and required commands.

`animation_preview` takes `frame_start`, `frame_end`, an optional fresh output
`directory`, `width`, `height`, `engine`, `camera` and `make_video` (default true).
By default it renders the current scene animation. Optional `clips` choose temporary
skeletal or morph actions, for example:

```json
{"frame_start": 1, "frame_end": 24, "camera": "Studio_Camera",
 "clips": [{"kind": "SKELETAL", "name": "Rig", "clip": "Walk"},
           {"kind": "MORPH", "name": "Body", "clip": "Walk"}]}
```

Each target accepts an optional `slot` for imported actions with ambiguous slots.
Clip selection follows the existing rig/morph restrictions (no constraints,
drivers or active NLA blending). The camera is not refitted per frame: allow room
for motion. The shim restores original clips/slots, pose, morph weights, frame and
subframe, camera and render settings on success, failure and cooperative
cancellation. PNG rendering bypasses the user's VSE timeline; MP4 assembly uses a
temporary VSE scene which is then removed. Existing scene contents and compositor
remain relevant to rendered frames. Video requires FFmpeg support, even dimensions
and consecutive frames; `make_video=false` allows a `frame_step` greater than one.

Outputs are `frame-*.png`, `manifest.json` and optional `preview.mp4` inside the new
directory. Operation results expose video/manifest and sample-frame artifacts;
failure/cancellation reports include available partial frames. The storage estimate
covers both PNGs and video, with free-space reporting during progress. Existing
directories are refused. Files remain after failure/cancellation; restoration does
not imply rollback after a process crash. Encoding retains native Blender blocking
and cancellation limits. Snapshot permission is required; a recovery checkpoint
may be saved before rendering a dirty scene, using the ordinary render policy.

The action engine also supports operator-defined JSON recipes.
Add `"action_files": ["actions.json"]` to the server
configuration; relative paths resolve beside that configuration file. Restart
the MCP frontend after changing a recipe. For example:

```json
{
  "format_version": 1,
  "actions": [{
    "name": "custom.make_prop",
    "version": "1",
    "description": "Create and inspect a named prop.",
    "inputs": {
      "name": {"type": "string", "description": "Unique object name."}
    },
    "steps": [
      {"id": "create", "command": "create_primitive", "params": {"name": {"$input": "name"}}},
      {"id": "inspect", "command": "inspect_mesh", "params": {"name": {"$input": "name"}}}
    ]
  }]
}
```

Use `list_actions`, then `describe_action` for the input schema, definition digest
and required capabilities. `plan_action` validates all inputs, step parameters,
permissions and library paths without starting Blender or editing the scene;
preparing output paths can create parent directories. Pass its `request_id` and
the same inputs to `run_action` for matching generated output paths. Request IDs
retain the usual operation deduplication rules; changed definitions or inputs
cannot silently reuse a different operation.

`run_action` defaults to asynchronous submission. With `wait=true`, it returns the
complete operation record, including failed or cancelled state and partial results.
Validation and permission errors are raised before submission. Steps execute
serially within one tracked operation. Progress includes completed steps, nested
operation progress and fresh storage reports. Known output estimates are summed;
some steps have unknown storage requirements. Each step also checks its storage
policy before execution. Completed output artifacts and available partial render
frames remain inspectable through operation status.

Recipes allow 1–64 steps and whole-value `{"$input": "name"}` references, including
inside lists and objects. Inputs support strings, integers, numbers, booleans,
string lists, three-component vectors and RGBA colors. They are strictly typed;
optional inputs require explicit defaults. Expressions, Python execution, nested
actions, project reloads, process lifecycle and network/API operations are excluded.
Every emitted constituent command must be permitted by the caller's policy.

Actions have no rollback: a failed or cooperatively cancelled step can leave scene
edits and files. Native blocking Blender calls retain their existing cancellation
limits. A frontend reconnect can retrieve the original operation by request ID;
interrupted operations are not automatically replayed or resumed step by step.
Live actions also retain their iterator across broker restarts. Transient progress
connection failures reconnect and retry the progress update with a bounded retry;
they do not dispatch the scene edit again. Application exit records an unknown
outcome and restores the last completed checkpoint when recovery is requested.
Inspect that recovered scene before deciding on a new operation.

## Configuration

See [examples/mcpblender.conf](examples/mcpblender.conf). JSON is the configuration
source. Paths beginning with `~` are expanded. Relative file tool paths are relative
to the active policy's `library_root`.

The default bridge socket is `~/.local/state/mcpblender/bridge.sock`. Its immediate
parent must belong to the current user with mode `0700`; the socket is `0600`.
All socket peers verify UID. A separate stdlib-only broker owns the socket and
durable SQLite operation journal; the Blender main-thread worker claims one
operation at a time. This keeps status/progress queries responsive during native
Blender work. The bridge has no network listener or remote API key.
Existing live sockets and non-socket files are preserved; owned stale sockets may
be replaced. This bridge controls one shared Blender session: different remote
keys do not get separate scenes or OS accounts.

`launch.executable`, `launch.background`, `launch.factory_startup`,
`launch.startup_timeout_seconds` and `launch.log_path` configure startup. Blender
continues running after ordinary client/server disconnects. Use `shutdown_blender`
for graceful shutdown. It refuses a dirty project unless a save path or explicit
discard is supplied, and disables automatic restart for that intentional shutdown.
`launch.shutdown_on_exit=true` opts a launching frontend into checkpoint-and-quit
on exit; this defaults false to support multiple independent connections.

`bridge.timeout_seconds` bounds the server's wait for a response. A timeout or
disconnect does **not** cancel queued or running Blender code, undo edits, or stop
a render. Inspect the session and log before retrying a mutation.

## Authentication and transports

The remote authentication formats and Argon2id KDF fields match mcpFreeCAD:

- `Authorization: Bearer <key>`
- `X-API-Key: <key>`
- `?mcp=<key>`
- `?api_key=<key>`

Precedence follows that order. Generate or rotate a named key with:

```sh
mcpblender --config ./mcpblender.conf --genkey design-agent
```

The key is printed once. Only its salted Argon2id hash is stored in the private
configuration file. Rotation preserves an existing key's policy. New keys inherit
the policy model defaults; edit their `library_root` and flags before remote use.
The configuration is loaded at startup; restart the MCP server after key rotation
or policy changes. This leaves Blender running.

```sh
mcpblender --config ./mcpblender.conf --transport stdio
mcpblender --config ./mcpblender.conf --transport remotehttp
```

`--remote` is an alias for selecting remote HTTP. Remote mode refuses to start
without an API key. `/status` is a public server liveness check and does not prove
Blender connectivity; use authenticated `bridge_status` for that.

Example internal client configurations (substitute real paths and issued keys):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "blender-local": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/.venv/bin/mcpblender",
      "args": ["--config", "/absolute/path/to/mcpblender.conf", "--transport", "stdio"]
    },
    "blender-remote": {
      "url": "https://mcp.example.com/blender/mcp/?mcp=ISSUED_KEY"
    }
  }
}
```

Stdio uses the `stdio` policy block, needs no remote API key, and keeps stdout
reserved for MCP. Both transports use the same Blender Unix socket.

HTTP can listen on loopback TCP or a Unix socket (`remote_server.uds` takes
precedence over host/port). For HTTPS behind Apache, see
[examples/apache.conf](examples/apache.conf). The URL key is intentionally
supported. Application access logging is disabled to avoid recording query keys;
configure the proxy access log with `%U` rather than `%r` or `%q`. Do not turn on
request URL debug logging. `remote_server.url_prefix` is the externally visible
base URL including the proxy path, used to construct artifact links.

## Policies, images and jobs

Each API key, and the stdio block, has these flags:

| Flag | Controls |
| --- | --- |
| `allow_code_execution` | Arbitrary Python execution |
| `allow_scene_edit` | Python, selection, transforms, frame changes, project open, asset import |
| `allow_library_write` | Project saves and GLB exports |
| `allow_snapshots` | Viewport images, camera renders and image retrieval |
| `allow_start_blender` | Explicit/lazy process startup and bridge restart |
| `allow_shutdown_blender` | Graceful application shutdown |
| `allow_external_assets` | Configured asset/API sources |
| `enable_autonomous_execution` | Advisory policy surfaced for orchestrators |

Disabled operations are hidden from tool discovery and denied on direct calls.
The autonomy flag is advisory, as in FreeCAD; the server adds no approval workflow.
Structured file tools resolve paths and reject traversal and symlink escapes from
`library_root`. Arbitrary Python has Blender's full OS permissions, so these roots
and per-key flags are not a Python sandbox. API keys share the same Blender scene.
Blender may also resolve linked dependencies of imported assets or projects;
the structured path check constrains the entry file, not Blender's internal reads.

`capture_viewport` returns an artifact identifier; `get_image` returns that image
as MCP image content. `render_still` returns a job identifier immediately; poll
`get_job`, then call `get_image` with the completed result's `artifact_id`.
Job state tracks durable broker operations; frame sequences and video encoding
report completed-frame progress. A native still render may have no finer progress. A camera
render occupies Blender's main thread and can leave the GUI busy until completion.

Remote artifacts have an authenticated `download_url` and, when an external URL
prefix is configured, a `download_url_with_token` valid for ten minutes. Artifact
ownership is checked for API-key downloads and jobs. Token links are bearer
capabilities that can be shared intentionally. Operation and artifact registries are private SQLite databases beside the socket
and survive MCP frontend restarts. The broker admits up to 128 queued/running
operations. Registered temporary outputs and operation history follow the configured
[retention policy](#temporary-outputs-and-retention); explicit deliverables remain
protected. History compaction preserves request-ID tombstones and does not vacuum
the databases. Snapshot permission permits generated image files even when general
library writes are disabled.

`execute_code` has `bpy` available and returns `success`, `stdout`, `stderr`, a
JSON-compatible `result`, and a traceback. Assign the output value to `result`:

```python
bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size=1)
obj = bpy.context.object
obj.name = "Prop_Block"
result = {"name": obj.name, "dimensions": list(obj.dimensions)}
```

Scripts can call `report_progress({...})` and `check_cancelled()` for cooperative
progress/cancellation. Each call has a fresh Python namespace. Scene data persists. Python exceptions
are reported with `success=false`; changes before the exception remain. Captured
Python stdout/stderr are capped at 128,000 characters each. Native Blender output
goes to the Blender log. The bridge bounds JSON messages to 8 MiB.

## Structured asset editing

Asset tools accept a typed `params` object, support `wait=false` and `request_id`,
and work when `allow_code_execution=false`. Editing requires `allow_scene_edit`;
`inspect_mesh` remains available to read-only clients.

- `inspect_mesh`: base or evaluated viewport geometry at the current frame, world
  bounds, triangle counts, boundary/non-manifold edges, degenerate faces, UV bounds
  and zero-area UV faces. Vertex samples are bounded (0–256); a geometry digest
  helps compare poses. The digest covers world vertices and polygon connectivity,
  not materials or UVs. This is not a self-intersection or UV-overlap test.
- `configure_modifier`: create/update a named `BEVEL`, `SUBSURF`, `DECIMATE`,
  `SOLIDIFY`, `TRIANGULATE` or `BOOLEAN` modifier with typed settings. Other stack entries
  remain intact. Settings include defaults; an update replaces the supported
  settings for that modifier. Angles are radians, distances are Blender units.
  Boolean settings name an operand `object`, choose `DIFFERENCE`, `UNION` or
  `INTERSECT`, and use the `EXACT` solver. Self-reference and cycles through
  Boolean operands, parents and constraint targets are rejected. Other imported
  dependency types are not comprehensively analyzed. Inspect the evaluated result
  before applying the modifier; the operand remains in the scene and export it
  only when intended.
- `apply_modifier` / `remove_modifier`: explicitly bake or discard a stack entry.
  Baking shared mesh data requires `make_single_user=true`; shape-key meshes are
  refused. Applying a later stack entry follows Blender's native stack behavior.
- `generate_uv`: SMART island projection or CUBE projection of all faces into a
  named map (`uv_map`, default `UVMap`). Existing coordinates require
  `overwrite=true`; shared meshes require `make_single_user=true`. SMART accepts
  `angle_limit_degrees` and `island_margin`; CUBE accepts `cube_size`. The target
  UV map becomes active. Inspect UV bounds and zero-area faces with `inspect_mesh`.
- `duplicate_object`: choose `new_name`, `linked_data` (default false) and an
  optional world-space `offset`. The copy is linked to the current collection.
  Parent, constraints, materials and animation action references are retained;
  duplicating geometry does not create independent copies of those resources.
- `set_parent`: set a named `parent` or omit it to unparent. `keep_world=true`
  preserves placement using the parent inverse. Cycles and singular parents are
  refused; clearing a parent with world shear is refused rather than losing it.
- `apply_transforms`: bake `location` (default false), `rotation` and `scale`
  (default true) into mesh geometry. Child world placement is preserved. Animated,
  constrained, shape-key or linked/overridden targets are refused; descendants
  must have static transforms and ordinary object parenting. Shared meshes need
  `make_single_user=true`. Modifier parameters are not rescaled automatically.
- `frame_objects`: fit an existing camera (`name`) to evaluated bounds of named
  meshes (`objects`). Choose `view` (`FRONT`, `BACK`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `TOP`,
  `BOTTOM`, `ISOMETRIC`) or a world `direction` from the asset toward the camera;
  `margin` defaults to 1.15. Fits perspective and orthographic cameras and reports
  normalized `projection_bounds` and `fully_in_frame`. Use `configure_camera`
  with `projection="ORTHO"` for an orthographic view. The camera must be static,
  unparented and have independent data. Fit uses current render aspect and frame;
  refit after changing them. Clipping distances may expand to accommodate the asset.

Asset mesh tools require Object mode; operator-based edits also require a visible,
selectable target in the current view layer. They restore object selection and
active object. Linked/overridden mesh editing is refused. Operations do not provide
rollback; inspect the scene after a failure.

Example `configure_modifier` arguments:

```json
{"params":{"name":"Prop","modifier":"SoftEdges","settings":{"type":"BEVEL","width":0.05,"segments":3}}}
```

## Mesh element editing and cleanup

Use `inspect_mesh_elements` with `domain=VERTEX`, `EDGE` or `FACE` to page the
stored base mesh. It returns local coordinates, world vertex positions, edge
adjacency, face centers/normals/material indices, shared-data usage and named
selections. Pass its `topology_sha256` as `expected_topology` to every indexed
edit. Optionally pass its `geometry_sha256` as `expected_geometry` to reject
coordinate changes too. This local-geometry fingerprint differs from the world
geometry digest returned by `inspect_mesh`; neither includes UVs/materials.
Evaluated modifier output is not a source of editable base-mesh indices.

`select_mesh_elements` takes a `domain` and `elements`, with exactly one of
`indices` or `selection` inside `elements`. An optional `selection_name` stores
the chosen indices on this object; replacing it requires `replace=true`.
Named selections survive save/reopen, but topology changes make them stale.
`remove_mesh_selection` removes a named group without editing geometry. Limits
are 64 names and 100,000 stored indices in total. Selection writes use a temporary
mesh and do not switch the user's Object/Edit mode or active object.

For example, inspect the roof face index and then call `extrude_mesh_faces`:

```json
{"params": {"name": "Building", "expected_topology": "COPY_CURRENT_TOPOLOGY_SHA256",
            "faces": {"indices": [5]}, "offset": [0, 0, 1]}}
```

The fingerprint and index are placeholders for inspected values. Reinspect after
every edit: indices and fingerprints can change even when vertex counts match.

- `extrude_mesh_faces`: extrude a face region by an explicit object-local offset.
- `inset_mesh_faces`: inset a region or individual faces by local `thickness`.
- `loop_cut_mesh`: cross a quad ring from seed `edge`, adding 1–32 evenly spaced
  cuts; non-quad or non-manifold rings are refused before assignment.
- `merge_mesh_vertices`: weld explicit/named `vertices` at `CENTER`, `FIRST` or
  `LAST` input position.
- `cleanup_mesh`: optional distance weld, degenerate-edge dissolution, loose
  edge/vertex removal and face-normal recalculation.
- `repair_mesh_normals`: recalculate all/selected faces `OUTSIDE` or `INSIDE`, or
  `FLIP` their winding. Outside is not well-defined for every open/nonorientable
  surface; inspect results. This does not author custom split normals.

These tools require local meshes in Object mode without shape keys or armature
deformation. Shared mesh data needs `make_single_user=true`. Geometry operations
work on a temporary BMesh/copy before replacing the object's data; preflight and
operation failures preserve the original geometry. A crash around assignment can
still leave an uncertain outcome. Existing UV layers and material slots are
preserved, but newly generated UVs may need re-unwrapping. Inspect topology,
materials and renders after editing. Mesh edits are limited to one million
vertices/faces; native operations are not forcibly interruptible. Ordinary
operation IDs, request-ID deduplication and broker reconnection apply.

## Structured Geometry Nodes

These tools accept `params` and work with Python execution disabled. Use
`geometry_node_catalog` to discover supported node types and up to 128 existing
groups; request a `node_type` for installed socket identifiers and property choices.
`inspect_mesh` includes the group name for Geometry Nodes modifiers.

`configure_geometry_graph` creates a named persistent group with automatic
Geometry input/output sockets and optional FLOAT, INT, BOOLEAN or VECTOR inputs.
Each input supplies a name, type and default, with optional numeric `minimum` and
`maximum` limits. Those limits persist in the group, appear in inspection, and are
enforced before modifier input updates. Nodes use catalog types, named
instances, allowlisted properties and typed input values. Socket references are
identifiers, unambiguous names or nonnegative indexes. Rotations use XYZ Euler
radians. `GeometryNodeSetMaterial` accepts a named existing `material`; assigning a
material slot on the original mesh does not color newly generated primitives.
`GeometryNodeStoreNamedAttribute` accepts `attribute` and allowlisted `data_type` /
`domain` settings. Primitive UV Map fields can be stored as `FLOAT2` on `CORNER`
under `UVMap` for textured PBR and GLB delivery.

For example, a reusable parameterized box:

```json
{"params":{
  "group":"ParametricBox",
  "inputs":[{"name":"Size","type":"VECTOR","default":[2,3,4]}],
  "nodes":[
    {"name":"Parameters","type":"NodeGroupInput"},
    {"name":"Box","type":"GeometryNodeMeshCube"},
    {"name":"Output","type":"NodeGroupOutput"}],
  "links":[
    {"from_node":"Parameters","from_socket":"Size","to_node":"Box","to_socket":"Size"},
    {"from_node":"Box","from_socket":"Mesh","to_node":"Output","to_socket":"Geometry"}]
}}
```

Use `attach_geometry_nodes` with `name` (mesh object), `group` and optional
`modifier` (default `GeometryNodes`). Different objects can share a group with
independent modifier inputs. Reattaching the same group preserves those values;
an existing modifier pointing elsewhere is refused. `configure_geometry_inputs`
takes `name`, `modifier`, `expected_graph` from inspection's `graph_sha256`, and
`values` containing `socket`/`value` pairs. Interface indexes count only editable
inputs, excluding Geometry. All values are preflighted before applying any;
objects with animation/drivers or inputs using named attributes are refused.

`inspect_geometry_graph` reports interfaces, nodes, defaults, links, users and a
graph fingerprint. Inspection includes imported groups, but editing/attachment
requires a local managed group without animation/drivers or unsupported nodes.
Results are bounded to 128 nodes and 256 links; truncated/unsupported graphs have
no usable fingerprint. Fingerprints cover supported graph configuration, including
material references, rather than the contents of referenced materials. Groups
have a fake user so they survive saving without a modifier attachment.

Replacing a managed graph requires `replace=true`, its current `expected_graph`
and no real users. Detach modifiers with `remove_modifier` first; this deliberately
prevents graph replacement from silently changing multiple attached objects.
Construction uses a temporary group; invalid nodes, properties, socket values,
links, cycles or output wiring preserve the original. Exactly one Group Output
with linked Geometry is required. Multi-input geometry joins are supported.
Nested groups, object references, simulation zones and executable nodes are not
exposed. Direct primitive counts are limited to 512 and subdivision levels to 3;
these limits do not bound geometry generated through fields, linked inputs or
successive modifiers. Inspect evaluated counts and render at representative sizes.

For delivery, `export_objects_glb` and `export_glb` accept explicit
`apply_modifiers=true` to include evaluated static geometry without baking the
editable source. This mode refuses shape-key/armature-deformed meshes. The default
keeps the existing base-mesh export behavior. Alternatively, explicitly bake a
modifier using `apply_modifier`, then inspect the resulting mesh before export.

### Reusable procedural presets

`create_geometry_preset` creates a named reusable group, then
`attach_geometry_nodes` attaches it to an existing mesh. The tool takes `group`
and a discriminated `settings` object. Materials are optional names of existing
materials; use `apply_material_preset` first for textured PBR or other surfaces.
Generated primitives carry a `UVMap` and material references. For example:

```json
{"params":{"group":"ApartmentExterior","settings":{
  "type":"BUILDING","floors":3,"columns":4,"width":8,"depth":5,
  "floor_height":3,"wall_material":"Brick","window_material":"Glass",
  "roof_material":"Roof"}}}
```

| Settings type | Parameters and exposed modifier inputs | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `BUILDING` | `floors` / `Floors` (1–32), `columns` / `Columns` (1–16), `width` / `Width`, `depth` / `Depth` (1–200), `floor_height` / `FloorHeight` (1–10); optional wall/window/roof materials | Solid exterior mass with a flat roof and repeated decorative window panels on front/back. It does not cut openings or provide interiors. |
| `VEGETATION` | `height` / `Height` (.5–30), `crown_radius` / `CrownRadius` (.1–10), `trunk_radius` / `TrunkRadius` (.02–2); fixed `segments` (3–32), optional trunk/leaf materials | Pine-style cylinder trunk and cone crown with its base at local Z=0. |
| `SCATTER_VEGETATION` | Tree parameters plus `density` / `Density` (0–50), `seed` / `Seed` (0–1000000), `spacing` / `Spacing` (.1–20), `max_points` / `MaxPoints` (1–2000) | Seeded Poisson distribution on the input surface, aligned to its normals, capped by point index, realized for delivery and joined with the original surface. |
| `REFINE_MESH` | `levels` / `Levels` (0–3), optional `material` | Catmull–Clark subdivision of the input mesh, retaining the editable source; this is not automatic remeshing or topology repair. |

Parameter names in settings use snake_case; exposed modifier names are shown after
the slash. Use `configure_geometry_inputs` with the current `expected_graph` to
change one object's values. Geometry inspection reports preset type/version,
limits, material references and each modifier's values. Invalid creation or
replacement preserves an existing group; the usual unused-group replacement
guard applies.

Scatter and refinement require the first modifier position and meshes without
shape keys or armature deformation. Bake upstream modifiers explicitly before
attaching them. Attach/input updates return `workload`: scatter estimates candidate
points as **local surface area × density**, refusing estimates above 20000, and
separately caps output instances to `MaxPoints`. Refinement estimates faces from
source polygon corners and subdivision levels, refusing estimates above 250000.
These are checks at those tool calls, not global memory limits or guarantees for
later source edits, native UI edits, fields or stacked modifiers. Distances and
density operate in object-local coordinates; object scale changes world spacing.
Inspect evaluated geometry, materials/UVs and a render before delivery.

## Rigid-body simulation and embedded bakes

Rigid tools work with Python execution disabled. Start with `inspect_physics`;
carry its `physics_sha256` into `expected_physics` for subsequent operations.
The fingerprint covers qualified rigid sources: world/FPS/gravity/cache range,
body properties, original transforms and base mesh coordinates/connectivity.
It excludes materials, temporary evaluation frame and volatile native cache flags.
Inspection paginates bodies and reports unsupported sources explicitly. A missing
fingerprint means the source set cannot be guarded by this workflow.

1. `configure_rigid_world` sets cache `frame_start`/`frame_end` (1–10000), FPS,
   gravity, time scale, solver iterations and substeps. These affect the whole scene.
2. `configure_rigid_body` binds/configures a named local mesh as `ACTIVE` or
   `PASSIVE`. Choose a convex primitive/hull shape for dynamic bodies; concave
   `MESH` collision is supported for passive bodies. Parameters include mass,
   friction, restitution, damping and collision margin. Existing configured
   parameters use the supplied model defaults when omitted.
3. `sample_rigid_bodies` takes up to 64 `objects` and 64 unique `sample_frames`,
   steps sequentially from cache start, and returns evaluated world matrices.
   It restores the original frame/subframe and retains the unbaked memory cache.
4. `bake_rigid_bodies` evaluates the entire configured range, finalizes the native
   cache, verifies pose checkpoints and writes an embedded-cache `.blend` copy to
   explicit `path` under `library_root`. Existing output is refused. The copy
   contains the **entire scene**, with source binding and start/middle/end poses;
   the active project path and original frame are preserved.
5. `validate_rigid_bake` checks the source binding and checkpoint matrices against
   the live baked cache. Validate after opening a snapshot, before relying on it.
   `clear_rigid_bake` explicitly frees the live cache/binding and rewinds to its
   start; saved snapshot files remain unchanged. `remove_rigid_body` removes only
   the binding, preserving the mesh/object.

For example, after inspecting the source fingerprint:

```json
{"params":{"name":"FloorCollider","type":"PASSIVE","collision_shape":"BOX",
  "expected_physics":"<physics_sha256>","reset_unbaked":true}}
```

Reinspect after configuration changes. Editing an evaluated unbaked cache requires
`reset_unbaked=true`; unknown/localized native cache descriptions are treated
conservatively. A baked cache must be cleared explicitly before editing its
configuration. Direct source edits make a saved bake's binding fail validation.
Native `is_outdated` is reported separately: the qualified installed Blender marks
reloaded embedded data outdated even when source binding and saved poses validate.
The native baked flag alone is not proof of a reusable result.

Sampling/baking return an operation immediately by default. Use `request_id` and
poll `get_operation` / `wait_operation`; `wait=true` is available for short runs.
Progress includes the current frame, completion counts and current free/available
storage. Bake estimates combine current project size, mesh/packed-image heuristics
and body-frame counts; available storage is checked before and during stepping
and before saving. Estimates are not hard output-size bounds. Cancellation works
between frames and restores the original frame, retaining partial memory caches.
Native finalization and `.blend` saving cannot be interrupted midway. Broker
restart does not replay evaluation; process interruption still requires inspecting
the operation outcome and latest completed project/checkpoint.

The qualified surface requires unparented, unconstrained, unanimated static local
collider meshes with positive scales, no modifiers/shape keys, BASE collision
geometry and no rigid constraints/compound colliders or force-field dependencies.
Use separate static proxy colliders or explicitly bake modeling modifiers first.
Body count is limited to 500 and source vertices to two million for fingerprinting.
The embedded workflow requires step-one caches with native disk/external flags
disabled. It does not supply cloth/soft-body/fluid/particle baking or convert rigid
motion to keyframes/GLB clips. Snapshot paths are explicit protected deliverables;
temporary-cache retention/cleanup for other backends remains separate work.

## Fluid authoring and isolated cache bundles

Fluid tools work with Python execution disabled. Call `inspect_fluids` and carry
its `fluid_sha256` as `expected_fluid` on authoring and baking commands. Reinspect
after changing a source. Unsupported dependencies produce an explicit reason and
no usable fingerprint. The current surface supports one static liquid/gas domain,
local mesh sources and static mesh collision effectors. Apply source scale before
configuration; a domain needs nonzero volume. Simulation source fingerprints
cover base meshes, transforms, controller settings, gravity, units, FPS and range.

- `configure_fluid_domain`: named mesh, `type` LIQUID/GAS, `resolution` 16–128,
  `frame_start`/`frame_end` (at most 500 frames inside 1–10000), `time_scale`,
  `gravity_weight` (0–1),
  `mesh_scale` 1–2 and six `use_collision_border_*` wall controls.
- `configure_fluid_flow`: named mesh, `type` LIQUID/SMOKE/FIRE/BOTH, `behavior`
  GEOMETRY/INFLOW/OUTFLOW, density, temperature, fuel, surface distance, initial
  `velocity` and subframes. Flow and domain types must match. Installed native
  parameter ranges are checked before creating/updating controllers.
- `configure_fluid_effector`: static mesh collision, surface distance,
  `use_effector` and subframes. `remove_fluid_controller` removes only an owned
  unbaked controller, preserving its mesh and files.

New controllers use modifier name `Fluid` unless supplied. Configuration values
not supplied use the contract defaults. The initial surface excludes animated or
deforming sources, parents/constraints, upstream modifiers, vertex-group/texture
dependencies, force fields, guiding, noise and secondary particles. The native
FLIP display modifier is disabled; liquid surface baking still uses solver
particles. These tools do not provide a gas volume-material preset or convert
simulation into GLB animation. Gas density checkpoints establish cached solver
output, rather than a finished smoke/fire look.

`bake_fluid` requires scene-edit and library-write permission. Supply a new
`directory`, domain `name` and current fingerprint, for example:

```json
{"params":{"name":"LiquidDomain","directory":"fluid/take-001",
  "expected_fluid":"<fluid_sha256>","threads":2},"wait":false,
  "request_id":"fluid-take-001"}
```

The operation returns immediately by default. Poll `get_operation` or
`wait_operation` and use a stable request ID across reconnects. It saves an
unbaked full-scene `source.blend` copy and launches an owned background Blender
worker. The editing instance's project/frame stay unchanged. The worker bakes
native data plus liquid surface geometry, samples start/middle/end, writes
`asset.blend`, and records cache/project hashes in `manifest.json`. Native cache
files remain in `cache/`; they are not embedded in the `.blend`. Its relative
`//cache` reference supports moving the entire bundle. External dependencies of
unrelated scene objects still need ordinary asset packaging.

`threads` defaults to 2 (maximum 16), `max_bytes` to 2 GiB (maximum 64 GiB), and
`timeout_seconds` to 1800 (10–86400). A conservative cell/frame/project heuristic
is checked against the budget and available space before saving/starting. While
the worker runs, progress reports its phase/PID, bytes/file count, estimated
output and current free space. Disk quota/reserve and timeout are checked during
polling, and final byte size is checked again. These are monitored estimates,
not a filesystem quota or a guarantee against other processes consuming space.

Cancellation stops/reaps only this owned worker and preserves partial output.
Native baking blocks the isolated worker; broker queries remain available.
Source snapshot saving in the editing instance remains noninterruptible. Hash
validation yields progress/cancellation in bounded batches. Broker restart keeps
the active worker/job; an editing-instance crash stops its child and leaves the
operation interrupted with unknown outcome. Do not replay that request blindly.

Open `asset.blend`, then call `validate_fluid_bake` with its bundle `directory`.
Validation checks file hashes, source/job/cache binding, and bounded native
liquid-geometry or gas-density checkpoints; it restores the original frame. It
does not prove every frame or target-engine behavior. Authoring cached imported
projects is refused: open the unbaked source copy, edit, and bake to a new bundle.

`inspect_fluid_job` reports ownership/state, process liveness and disk usage.
`recover_fluid_job` reconciles a running marker only after its recorded parent and
worker are gone. A complete bound manifest is adopted without replay, with native
validation still required; an incomplete result becomes interrupted.
`cleanup_fluid_job` defaults to `dry_run=true`. Explicit application can remove an
owned failed/cancelled partial bundle; interrupted output additionally requires
`include_interrupted=true`. Successful deliverables, live workers, current-project
references, symlinks and unknown entries are protected. Existing output directories
are never overwritten; there is no automatic expiration of explicit fluid bundles.

## Structured skeletal animation

`create_armature`, `bind_mesh` and `inspect_rig` take typed `params` and work with
Python execution disabled. Creation/binding require scene-edit permission;
inspection is available to read-only clients.

Create bones from armature-local `head`/`tail` positions, optional `parent`,
`connected` and `roll_degrees`. The armature object's `location` places the whole
skeleton. Bone names must be unique, connected heads must match parent tails,
and cyclic parent relationships are rejected before submission. Creation
preserves active object and selection and never replaces an existing object.

`bind_mesh` names the mesh in `name` and the skeleton in `armature`:

- `AUTO` (default) uses Blender's native bone-heat weighting.
- `RIGID` assigns all vertices to the named `bone` with weight one.
- `EXPLICIT` accepts `weights`, e.g. `[{"vertex":0,"weights":{"Base":0.5,"Tip":0.5}}]`.
  Each vertex index appears once; weights normalize by default.

Bind an unparented, unbound mesh before animating the skeleton, with bones in an
unconstrained rest pose. Existing armature modifiers and conflicting bone-named
groups are refused. Shared mesh data requires `make_single_user=true`.
`require_complete=true` rejects incomplete coverage. Failed binding removes its
new groups/modifiers and restores placement; an isolated mesh copy may remain.
Native automatic weighting can occupy Blender's main thread; operation/storage
status remains available through the broker.

`inspect_rig` reports rest and evaluated pose matrices/endpoints, bone hierarchy,
and skin coverage, weight sums and sampled influences. Bone results are paginated
with `bone_offset`/`bone_limit`. At most 32 bound scene meshes are inspected
automatically; supply `meshes` for a specific subset. Counts identify truncation.

`create_animation_clip` names the rig in `name` and the new action in `clip`.
Supply `tracks` with a bone, property (`location`, `rotation_degrees` or `scale`)
and vector keyframes. Rotations use XYZ Euler **degrees** in bone-local rest
coordinates; translation uses the same local axes. Clips persist through saving
even when inactive. `activate` defaults true; existing action names are refused.

```json
{"params":{"name":"Arm","clip":"Wave","tracks":[{"bone":"Tip","property":"rotation_degrees","keyframes":[{"frame":1,"value":[0,0,0]},{"frame":12,"value":[45,0,0]}]}]}}
```

Use `set_pose_keyframes` to insert/replace specified keys in a managed clip. Other
tracks/frames remain, and only touched keys receive the chosen interpolation.
`set_active_clip` switches clips, resetting unkeyed bone channels to rest to avoid
leaking the previous pose. Omit `clip` to clear the action and reset pose.
These clip tools support ordinary skeletal actions without constraints, drivers
or active NLA blending. Muted NLA stashes created by glTF import are supported;
selecting a clip disables NLA evaluation for single-action playback. Authoring rotations requires XYZ bones; imported compatible
skeletal actions can be selected using their `slot` identifier when ambiguous.

`inspect_animation` lists paginated actions/slots and reports channel paths, key
counts and ranges for a chosen or active action. The action list is global;
`managed_target` identifies clips authored for a specific rig. A chosen action
must resolve to skeletal channels on that rig.

`sample_animation` evaluates up to 64 `frames`, optionally in a chosen `clip`,
returning bone world endpoints and evaluated geometry for up to eight bound
`meshes`. Samples restore the previous frame, subframe, action, slot and original
pose channels, including on cooperative cancellation. Sampling is available to
read-only keys but needs a local rig for temporary evaluation and can mark Blender
dirty. Use sampled vertices/bounds as deformation evidence; inserted keys alone
do not prove skinning is correct. `inspect_rig` gives the current pose and weights.

## Structured shape keys

`create_shape_key`, `edit_shape_key`, `inspect_shape_keys`,
`set_shape_key_weights` and `remove_shape_key` use typed `params`. They work with
Python execution disabled; inspection is available to read-only keys.

Create a named `key` on mesh `name`. Basis is created automatically, and new keys
start at weight zero. Supply sparse `vertices` entries such as
`{"vertex":2,"value":[0,0,0.5]}`: `mode="OFFSET"` means displacement from Basis;
`mode="POSITION"` means absolute mesh-local coordinates. Offsets do not accumulate
when repeated. Alternatively supply `source_object` with matching ordered vertex,
edge and polygon topology; its raw local reference coordinates become the shape.
Source object transforms, modifiers and active morph weights are not copied.

Coordinate editing preserves unspecified vertices; `reset_unspecified=true`
resets them to Basis first. Basis editing and absolute shape-key workflows are
refused. Imported relative keys must be relative to Basis to edit coordinates.
`expected_topology` can carry the fingerprint from inspection to reject stale
index-based edits. A stored fingerprint also detects topology changes after a
managed edit. Matching connectivity cannot prove semantic vertex correspondence
on symmetrical/reindexed assets; check the resulting deformation.

Static weights use `values` in [0,1], optionally `reset_others=true`. Shared meshes
need `make_single_user=true` for coordinate/weight/deletion edits. Inspection
reports key values, mute/mask settings, coordinate digests, changed-vertex counts
and samples. Samples for non-Basis keys contain changed vertices. Deletion refuses
Basis, relative-key dependencies and known animation references.

`create_morph_clip` names the mesh in `name`, the action in `clip`, and accepts
`tracks` such as `{"key":"Wide","keyframes":[{"frame":1,"value":0},{"frame":12,"value":1}]}`.
Clips persist while inactive; `activate=false` preserves the current weights and
action. `set_morph_keyframes` updates specified scalar keys without replacing
other frames or action slots. Clip editing can leave partial keys on failure;
there is no general editing rollback. New clips/slots are removed if creation fails.

`set_active_morph_clip` selects a compatible KEY slot and resets unkeyed values to
zero; omitting `clip` clears the action and weights. Static weight setting also
exits shape-key solo preview so the requested mixture can be evaluated. Morph
animation needs independent mesh data. Drivers and active NLA blending are
refused; muted glTF import stashes are supported. `inspect_morph_animation` lists
global actions/slots and reports tracks/key counts for the selected morph slot.

For combined skeletal/morph animation, create the skeletal clip first, then call
`create_morph_clip` with the **same clip name** and `join_existing=true` on its bound
mesh. This explicitly adds a KEY slot to the managed action; the existing OBJECT
slot and bone keys remain intact. Multiple meshes can have independent KEY slots
in one managed clip. Joining an unrelated skeletal rig's action is refused.

`sample_morph_animation` returns weights and evaluated geometry at up to 64 frames.
Use `armature` and `skeletal_clip` to choose and sample the corresponding bone
animation in the same operation. Omitting `skeletal_clip` preserves the rig's
current action; no action leaves its current pose in use. Sampling restores the
previous frame/subframe, weights, actions, slots, solo-preview state and any
explicitly sampled rig pose, including on cooperative cancellation. Temporary
evaluation may mark Blender dirty. Inspect the actual rendered result as well.

`get_scene_info` and `get_object_info` include a shape-key count on mesh objects.
glTF import may create additional bone-display meshes; use this count or
`inspect_shape_keys` to identify the asset mesh when reviewing imported morphs.

## Blender to Godot

Use Blender for modeling, materials, UVs, rigging and animation; export selected
assets with `export_glb`. The initial export uses Blender's glTF exporter, GLB,
standard glTF +Y up, and uncompressed meshes. Animation export is configurable.
Use explicit `apply_modifiers=true` for evaluated static geometry, including
Geometry Nodes; this does not change the editable source. Shape-key and
armature-deformed meshes require the normal animation-preserving export mode.

Animated exports use native `ACTIONS` mode. Managed clips belonging to each
exported rig or relative shape-key datablock are included through temporary muted
NLA tracks, removed afterward; the live action, pose, weights and frame are
restored. Skeletal and morph slots in one action merge into one named glTF clip.
Morph-only exports retain inactive managed clips and static default weights too.
Existing active actions/NLA clips
remain eligible, but Blender's automatic broadcasting of unrelated actions to a
single rig is disabled. Select both the rig and its meshes for skeletal delivery.
This does not select a subset of an existing complex NLA project; inspect its
actions and tracks before exporting.

Before export, verify object dimensions, scene unit scale, origins, local axes,
selection, normals, materials and desired animation clips. Keep the editable
`.blend` project alongside the GLB. Godot import, collision setup, shader fidelity
and game behavior require checks in the Godot project; GLB creation alone does
not prove that integration.

The installed FreeBSD Blender 5.0.1 glTF add-on crashes in its Draco library-name
probe even when compression is disabled. Our structured import/export calls use a
scoped in-memory workaround only when that FreeBSD probe raises `TypeError`.
It disables Draco availability for the operation and restores the original probe
afterward. Fixed Blender versions are left alone. Installed Blender files are
unchanged, and Draco-compressed assets are not supported by this workaround.

## Long operations and recovery

`submit_operation(command, params, request_id)` returns immediately for any
structured operation, including Python, imports/exports, renders and API transfers.
New domain tools use a typed `params` object and accept `wait` and `request_id`;
long renders and API transfers default to asynchronous execution.
`execute_code(..., wait=false)` is also supported.

Poll `get_operation` or bounded `wait_operation`, or recover IDs using
`list_operations`. `get_job` remains a render polling alias. A wait timeout does
not fail/cancel the operation. Reusing a request ID with identical command arguments
returns the same operation; changed arguments are rejected. Deduplication is scoped
to the API key (or the shared `stdio` identity).

Multiple frontends/connections share one broker. Blender operations execute
serially, and an animation sequence holds its turn across frames. Use a named
action or one Python operation when edits must form an uninterrupted batch. There
is no rollback. Queued work can be cancelled; running Python must call `check_cancelled`,
and frame sequences stop between frames. Native blocking calls and VSE video
encoding are not forcibly interrupted.

The frontend/worker reconnect after broker restart; `restart_bridge` exercises
this while preserving Blender. Claimed work is not claimed twice, and completion
acknowledgements can be retried. If Blender exits, unfinished work becomes
`interrupted` with `outcome_unknown=true`; edits are never automatically replayed.

For server-launched instances, `launch.auto_recover=true` supervises Blender
independently of frontend connections. It allows `launch.max_recovery_attempts`
restarts until an explicit launch resets the budget. A live busy process is not a
crash. Intentional shutdown disables recovery. Manually attached instances are
not taken over by the supervisor.

Recovery copies follow successful edits, throttled by
`launch.checkpoint_interval_seconds` (default 30). Dirty scenes are checkpointed
before renders; `checkpoint` forces a copy. Files live beside the socket in
`recovery/`; `launch.checkpoint_copies` defaults to three. Rotation removes only
older service-generated checkpoints. Recovery opens the latest completed copy
with auto-execution disabled. `start_blender(recover=false)` requests fresh startup.
Status reports checkpoint/recovery paths and errors, application session and broker
epoch. Edits after the last checkpoint and in-flight external effects may be lost
or uncertain.

## Storage feedback

`storage_status` reports current free bytes, configured reserve, usable space and
warnings for the active library. Operation status includes fresh storage data even
while Blender is busy; frame/download progress also carries it. Renders, downloads,
saves and checkpoints check capacity before admission and execution. Frame renders
and streaming downloads recheck as output grows.

`storage.reserve_bytes` defaults to 256 MiB; `storage.warn_below_bytes` to 2 GiB.
Estimates identify conservative pixel bounds, configured download limits,
heuristics, or unknown sizes. They cannot predict arbitrary Python output or quotas;
other processes may consume space after a check. Failures retain completed files;
the server never deletes user output to make room.

## External asset and generation APIs

Configure named `asset_sources` in private JSON:

```json
{
  "asset_sources": {
    "generator": {
      "base_url": "https://assets.example.com/api/",
      "headers": {"Authorization": "Bearer PROVIDER_CREDENTIAL"},
      "timeout_seconds": 120,
      "max_bytes": 268435456
    }
  }
}
```

`request_asset_api` submits JSON requests or polls provider jobs. `download_asset`
streams a result into the library, optionally verifies SHA-256 and publishes it
atomically. Import models with `import_asset`; use images in `configure_material`.
`upload_asset` sends refined assets with PUT/POST. Credentials, signed URLs and
request bodies stay outside the journal. Resources and redirects must remain on
the configured origin.

These are generic HTTP/JSON/file adapters. Specific diffusion services may require
multipart or other provider-specific adapters. No real/paid provider is configured
or qualified. Network jobs continue independently of Blender; a broker exit makes
unfinished transfers uncertain. Remote POST/upload effects are not replayed.

## Representative editing fixture

```sh
python3 tools/building_workflow.py /tmp/CHOOSE_A_NEW_BUILDING_DIRECTORY
```

This fixture retains an editable exterior building with image-textured brick, roof,
windows/glazing, a door, trim, lights and an animated camera. It round-trips an awning
through an authenticated loopback API, packs the texture, saves/reopens the project,
exports GLB, renders 12 frames, assembles image/text/sound strips in Blender's VSE,
and exports H.264/AAC MP4. `ffprobe` independently checks video dimensions, frame
count and audio. The API fixture does not exercise an actual diffusion model.

## Skills and verification

Repository skills:

- [blender-mcp-design](skill/blender-mcp-design/SKILL.md): modeling, inspection and asset preparation.
- [blender-mcp-render](skill/blender-mcp-render/SKILL.md): materials, lighting, camera previews and image review.
- [blender-mcp-animation](skill/blender-mcp-animation/SKILL.md): animation, frame sequences and video delivery.

Install these repository-owned skills explicitly with `tools/install_skills.py`;
see [skill installation](README.md#skills). The installer preserves Codex metadata
and adapts copies for PQC. Package installation alone does not install skills.
Tool descriptions remain usable by other MCP agents.

```sh
python3 -m pytest -q
MCPBLENDER_TEST_BLENDER=1 python3 -m pytest -q
```

The opt-in suite starts disposable background Blender in a private `/tmp` directory,
uses real stdio and HTTP clients, and terminates only its own test processes.
For a separately authorized GUI smoke test, run
`python3 tools/gui_smoke.py /tmp/CHOOSE_A_NEW_EVIDENCE_DIRECTORY` on the current
display. It retains a test project, viewport image, log and JSON evidence, then
stops only its own Blender process.
See [VALIDATION.md](VALIDATION.md) for the checks performed on this host and their limits.
